# spiral
Project #1 from CS313E; Prints a 9-number section of a larger clock-wise number spiral.

# deeper explanation
Imagine that numbers are printed in a grid, in a sequential and clock-wise manner. This program reads in a text file called "spiral.txt" containing two lines. Line one contains n, the dimension of the grid (n^2). Line two contains the center number of the 9-number section that the program is designed to print.

#future improvements
In this program, the spiral of dimension size n x n is actually created inside of a list. Future improvements to this program would include using a formula based on square location to print the 9-number section without populating the list.
